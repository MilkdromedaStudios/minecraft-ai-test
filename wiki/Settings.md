# Settings

Every option can be changed two ways: the in-game **settings screen** or the
**`/ai settings`** command. Both write to the same `config/blockpal/config.json`.

> **Operator-only (3.2.0+).** Settings are server-wide, so **changing** them — the
> menu, `/ai token`, and `/ai settings <key> <value>` — requires admin permission
> (`adminPermissionLevel`, default 2 = ops). Reading the list with `/ai settings`
> stays open to everyone. See **[Security](Security)** and **[Admin Menu](Admin-Menu)**.

## Settings screen — `/ai menu`

Open with `/ai menu` (always works) or — unless disabled — sneak-right-click on the
assistant. It's a five-tab screen:

| Tab | What's here |
|-----|-------------|
| **Identity** | Name, skin, **Open skins folder** button |
| **Behavior** | Chat listening, active analysis, sneak-to-open-menu, follow distance, guard radius, [performance preset](Performance-Presets) |
| **AI** | API URL, model, token, temperature, max tokens |
| **Combat** | Allow commands, permission level, flee health |
| **Developer** | Action tick delay, task watchdog timeout, flee health *(high-risk — see [Developer Menu](Developer-Menu))* |

- Each setting has a hover **tooltip** explaining it.
- Edits are held in a draft and captured on each tab switch, so moving between tabs
  doesn't lose changes.
- **Save / Apply / Cancel** bar is pinned at the bottom; **Esc** auto-saves.
- The body scrolls (mouse wheel + scrollbar) to fit any screen size.
- The token field stays blank when one is set — leave it blank to keep the current
  token, or type a new one to replace it.

## Command-line settings

```
/ai settings                            # show all current values
/ai settings model mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
/ai settings api_url http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions
/ai settings temperature 0.7
/ai settings max_tokens 512
/ai settings follow_distance 4
/ai settings guard_radius 16
/ai settings sneak_menu false           # disable sneak-right-click to open menu
/ai settings preset potato              # apply a performance preset
```

## Full list of keys

`name` · `skin` · `model` · `api_url` · `token` · `temperature` · `max_tokens` ·
`follow_distance` · `guard_radius` · `command_level` · `admin_level` · `max_bots` ·
`max_task_seconds` · `action_tick_delay` · `flee_health` · `chat_listening` ·
`active_mode` · `allow_commands` · `debug_logging` · `sneak_menu` · `preset`

> `max_task_seconds`, `action_tick_delay` and `flee_health` are the high-risk
> Developer-tab settings — read **[Developer Menu](Developer-Menu)** before changing them.

### Admin & limits

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `admin_level` | Permission level (0/2/4) needed to change settings or use `/ai admin`. Default **2** (ops). `4` = full operator / world owner only. |
| `max_bots` | Max Blockpal entities on the server at once; `/ai summon` refuses past it. Default **8**, `0` = unlimited. Also `/ai admin maxbots <n>`. |

### API token security

The token is **never** shown back, never logged, and stored **obfuscated** in
`config.json` (`hfTokenObf`) rather than as plain text. For the strongest protection,
set it via the `BLOCKPAL_API_TOKEN` environment variable instead — then it's used but
never written to disk. Full details in **[Security](Security)**.

## Persistence & versioning

Settings live in `config/blockpal/config.json` (auto-migrated from the old flat
`config/blockpal.json`). The file carries a `configVersion` stamp:

- Missing or corrupt → regenerated from defaults.
- From an older mod version → newly-added fields are filled with their intended
  defaults (not Java's false/0), while existing values like your API key are preserved.

So your API key carries across mod updates, and a deleted file just comes back as
defaults.
